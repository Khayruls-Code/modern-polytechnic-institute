Heat exchangers are designed with high-precision prediction methods and complex numerical techniques to account for the local flow and temperature conditions. Fouling mitigation is just changing from an art to a science-based technology. The real benefits of sophisticated design codes will not be achieved without reliable fouling prediction methods and mitigation techniques that can be incorporated into the design phase",
